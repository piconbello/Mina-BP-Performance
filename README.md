Intro
=====

For epochs we will share the witness data. Following this repository https://github.com/zkvalidator/mina-vrf-rs anyone with witness data can verify which slots we won. 

After end of the epochs we will update the performance data by running this script https://gist.github.com/garethtdavies/18ee98214bb3511bc2d59a9b8998ea17 which relies on minaexplorer. This is also can be verified by anyone since slot data can be gathered from witness data we provided.
